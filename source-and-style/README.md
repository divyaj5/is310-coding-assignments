Website: Europeana
Web Technologies Used
* HTML: Europeana's structure is built using HTML. Upon opening the Developer Tools and looking under the Elements tab, I found various HTML elements like <div>, <header>, <section>, and <footer>. These tags form the basic building blocks of the webpage.
* CSS: The site uses CSS to style its content. By checking the <head> section in the page source, I found multiple <link> tags pointing to .css files. These stylesheets handle the layout, fonts, colors, and overall design.
* JavaScript: JavaScript is heavily used to make the site interactive and dynamic. I found several .js files loaded when browsing through the site. These scripts take care of things like animations, data fetching, and other interactive elements.
* Other Technologies: Besides HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site also loads various fonts and icons from external services like Google Fonts. It also uses some third-party services for analytics and tracking, which is spotted by checking the network requests in the Developer Tools.
Who Built the Website?
* The site mentions that it's created by the Europeana Foundation, along with various partners. 
GitHub Repository
* There isn't a direct link to a GitHub repository on the main site. However, by doing a quick search for "Europeana GitHub," I found Europeana's GitHub profile. They host various projects related to digital culture and APIs there.
