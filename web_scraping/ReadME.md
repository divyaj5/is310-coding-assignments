Fandom Wikis and Web Scraping Homework

Fandom Wiki: Disney Princess Wiki
I am going to scrape the Disney Princess Wiki. (https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Disney_Princess) This Wiki offers extensive information on the Disney Princess franchise, which is popular among both fans and researchers. It contains rich data about characters, their film debuts, original voice actors, and their impact on popular culture. I am particularly interested in scraping data related to the official Disney Princess members. he file provides insight into the role of voice actors in shaping the identity of animated characters. Researchers can investigate how the vocal performances of actors like Jodi Benson (Ariel) and Ming-Na Wen (Mulan) contributed to the characters' popularity and relatability. The films associated with these characters have significant cultural footprints. By studying the voice actors and their corresponding films, researchers can analyze the impact of Disney's storytelling on cultural narratives and values.

What you will need to run the fandom_wiki_scraping.py file:
